Scaffolding automatically creates code to model data and interact with it through the web.
Scaffolding is good for getting started quickly but is bad for understanding.
Rails uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for structuring web applications.
As interpreted by Rails, the REST architecture includes a standard set of URLs and controller actions for interacting with data models.
Rails supports data validations to place constraints on the values of data model attributes.
Rails comes with built-in functions for defining associations between different data models.
We can interact with Rails applications at the command line using the Rails console.
